Today I started off by trying to finish off my quiz. Because my original quiz was constantly showing errors I decided to ask my friends for help and I restarted. I added a small sentence at the start to describe what the quiz was about and then I began on re-doing my quiz.

 choice=input(" A.Ed Sheeran\n B.Stormzy\n C……………..\n

  if choice.upper()=="A":

    print ("nice")

    score+=50

This was the biggest difference in my new quiz. This meant that after you were asked the question you would input an answer. Then depending on your answer it would add or subtract 50 to your score. By the end I put in a line saying if your score was above a certain score then it would return a certain message.
