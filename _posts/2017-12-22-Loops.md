Today we were looking at more things you could do on repl.it. Today we looked at loops. By using loops you can create bits of code which keep on adding something on by looping the code and by going over it numerous times until you hit a certain amount. 

But today we were using it for a worksheet which added another 2p onto someone's pocket money which they received every week. Eg; Week 1=2p

                                                                       Week 2=4p

                                                                       Week 3=6p

The point of the worksheet was to create a loop which would add a certain amount of money each week so at any point I could say how much money the person had.

pocketMoney = 0.01

for week in range(1,27):

 print("\nIt is week" ,week)

 print("You will get £" ,pocketMoney)

 totalMoney = totalMoney + pocketMoney

pocketMoney = pocketMoney * 2

print("\n\nTotal pocketMoney to date £",totalMoney)
