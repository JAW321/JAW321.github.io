So far in IT we have looked at how to write coded messages so if someone intercepted the message they wouldn't understand it. First we thought about how we could mix the letters together. One of the ways we did this was by using a random word at the start of the alphabet and carried on with the letters but this meant that some letters would be exactly the same in the code. Eventually I split the alphabet into 5 groups of letters with one with 6. Then I ordered these randomly so everything was muddled up.

 Because typing each individual letter out would take a long time. I used a thing called VLOOKUP which took the letters and decoded them into the message so it was a lot quicker process than typing out each individual letter.
