Today we started the lesson by learning about how to compress drawing you do on a google. We started off by drawing a picture on our google sheet. I chose to draw a face. One I had the drawn the face with different colors to make it more detailed and interesting. After that I began to compress the drawing.

This is what it looked like after compressing it. What this meant was whatever row you looked at by looking at the key you could see how many of that colour you drew across.
