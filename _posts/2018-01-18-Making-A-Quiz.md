Today we started the lesson very differently. Instead of coding we went onto BuzzFeed and did lots of their quizzes. After about about 15 minutes of this we then came back to the front of the class and talked about how the quizzes worked. For example, in the quiz I did it guessed your age based on a certain image you clicked.

What is happening is, if you click on a certain image inside the code it will say 

If (a certain picture is clicked) do this

After discussing how it worked we then made up our own questions on a certain topic which we would then write in code the next week.
