My shop by today was very good. I now had made it so you could have an option f what product you want and also choose a quantity. This was a lot more efficient than last week when I typed in every product and the quantity. 

Obviously in many shops they have gift cards and discounts. So this was the next step. I had to put the percentage I  was going to discount the product and wrote out some code to make it when the computer added up the total it would subtract a certain amount off.
