Today we started off by recapping some simple python functions such as how to create a sequence of questions which the computer and the user can answer.

I started off by making the computer say hello. I knew this already and by saying 

**Print ("hello")**

 it makes the computer write hello on the other side of the screen. This is a really easy skill and I then went on to writing questions which could be answered and return a comment. To do this I wrote,

**name = input("What is your name?")**

**print("Hi " +  name )**

This meant that you could input any letters to create a name and it it would return with **Hi + name**. Another skill I used was asking a question and depending on the answer it would ask another or return a comment. I wrote,

**x = input("Are you good + (yes or no)?")**

**if x.lower() == "yes":**

** print ("That's great " + name)**

**elif x.lower() == "no":**

** print("That's a shame " + name)**

**else:**

** print("I do not understand")**

The part which says x.lower() means whatever way you write yes the computer will turn the whole word into lowercase. The if function means if you answer a certain way it will print something and else (if not) print this.
