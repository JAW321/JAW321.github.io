Today we carried on with what we have been doing in previous weeks by putting in all the code to make the code smooth. But today we were trying to make the code look a lot neater so when your message was written it would automatically make it so it was encrypted. This meant the person who intercepted the message wouldn't know what it meant. 

 My code is quite good, I just need to make it a lot neater because at the moment you can see all the background formula and code so it is very confusing.
