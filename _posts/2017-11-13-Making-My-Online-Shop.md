Today we started on a new google sheet. We were going to use our coding knowledge to make a shop which would sell some items. We would create prices for these and then put in formula to calculate prices. 

I used clothing as my main thing to sell. Once I had decided to prices for all the items I used the VLOOKUP tool to select a product which would show up with a price at the end of the line. Because if you go shopping you might want a bigger quantity, so I had to make it so whatever number you put into the system for a quantity it would multiply the price by that much. To do this I just wrote a certain cell multiplied by the other.

Eg. =F2*G2

Finally I made it so once you had added all the items it would come up with the amount of items and the final price. I did this by using a piece of code saying, 

=SUM(H2:H11)

This meant all the amounts in those cells would add up to create a final total.
